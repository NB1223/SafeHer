SafeHer

We aim to empower female employees by providing a secure and confidential channel to report workplace issues and harassment.
We provide a platform where female employees can submit complaints about workplace misconduct without revealing their identity.
We anonymously transmit verified complaints to the respective company's HR or designated department for investigation.
We also provide resources to support women facing workplace challenges, such as legal advice, counseling, and support groups if they are not satisfied with the level of action taken.Throughout the entire process we maintain strict confidentiality of user data and complaint details.

To be done:
1. ML model to verify complaints
2. Better UI
3. Implement method to accept proof of harassement
